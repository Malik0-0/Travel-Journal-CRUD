<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Making this simple application aims to complete the Module 1 Capstone Project at Purwadhika. Here the application is required to use CRUD and add additional features that can be created as a requirement for passing this Capstone Project. And Project Travel Journal simply has the same function as a notepad which can record the history of travel that the user has done.

The following are the features available:

* Create Function:

  This application already has a Create function, namely adding or creating a new journal by entering the Title, Content, Date and Location.
* Read Function:

  Users can also view journals that are already in the database by using the Read function in this application. Users can view all journals created by running the "Show Journal" feature.
* Update Function:

  Users can also edit journals that have been added or edit existing journals. Users can edit the Title, Content, Date and Location.
* Delete Function:

  If the user wants to delete a journal, the user can directly use the Delete function in this application by running the Delete feature and the selected journal will be deleted in the Database.

Apart from that, there are several additional features such as the Journal Search feature using Keywords, the Journal Sorting feature by Date, the Filter feature based on a Specific Year, the Filter feature using a Specific Year Range and the Travel Summary feature.

The following are the additional features available:

* Search Function:

  The Journal Search feature using Keywords is used to search journals based on keywords entered by the user. Then the system will search for the keyword and if the keyword is in the title or content of the journal, the journal will be displayed.
* Sorting Function:

  The Sorting Journals by Date feature is used when the user wants to sort according to the date in each journal. After sorting, the sorted journals will be displayed in order of the earliest date.
* Filter Function:

  There are two filter options in the additional features, Filter by Specific Year and Filter by Specific Year Range. The Filter by Year feature can make it easier for users to view journals for a particular year. For example, a user wants to see a certain journal only for 2024, then the system will only display journals for 2024.

  The Filter by Year Range feature is not much different from the previous feature, only the user can determine the start year and end year in the filter and the system will display journals according to that year range.
* Summarize Function:

  And the last additional feature is to show users a summary of the trips they have made based on the journals in the database and categorized by year.
